# IOT-BASED-THREE-PHASE-POWER-FAILURE-MONTORING-SYSTEM
The project is designed to monitor and analyze a three-phase electrical system using an ATMEGA 328 microcontroller. R-phase, Y-phase, and B-phase transformers are used to sense the voltage levels of each phase. The bridge rectifier converts the AC signals from the transformers into DC signals suitable for the microcontroller.
